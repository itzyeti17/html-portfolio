<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>akame ga kill(not a movie IK)</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime. I love that its short but even thought it short it still has a good pace and does not speed anything up.</p>
<h3>cobra kai(not a movie IK)</h3>
<p>I like it becuase of how stupid it is, There are really funny moments that arnt funny becuase they are but becuase they are so stupid </p>
